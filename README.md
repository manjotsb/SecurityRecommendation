Project Phase 6: Security Recommendations
Introduction
In this phase of the project, you will work individually to research and then produce a security recommendation for your group’s mobile app project. This recommendation can focus on something that is already being incorporated into the project, or something that may be incorporated into the project.
While some class time will be provided, you should also plan to invest time outside of class. Please see Brightspace for exact due dates and the course schedule.
Plagiarism detection software will be used on all student submissions. Please refer to SAIT’s policies and procedures on Student Academic Conduct (A.C.3.4.3) for more information.
Instructions
1.	Review all instructions and the Marking Criteria section before beginning your work.
2.	This is an individual assessment; each student completes and submits their own work.
3.	Choose one of the mobile app security recommendations from the Android App Security Checklist (https://github.com/muellerberndt/android_app_security_checklist).
4.	Create a Word document to review your group’s mobile app project through a security lens by answering the following questions: 
The App does not log any sensitive data of the user, this is a crucial security practice which protects user privacy from any unintentional data leaks. By not logging data, the app complies with data protection standards which builds a secure app for future.
a.	What is your security recommendation? Why did you choose it?
i.	Some recommendations may not apply to the project (i.e.: biometric authentication, password policies, etc.). The app does not need Biometric authentication or Disabling Keyboard Caching.
ii.	If you’re unable to determine an appropriate recommendation, see your instructor for guidance
b.	Who does the recommendation benefit (end-user, developer, etc.)? End User
c.	If the recommendation was found somewhere other than the provided checklist, include a link to it. Yes, this recommendation is found all over the internet and is a fundamental practice for security
d.	When would the recommendation have to be implemented (based on how serious the security risk is)? Security risk of storing sensitive user information is extremely high and this security recommendation should be implemented before the deployment of the project or as soon as possible if the project is already deployed
e.	Why do you think your project needs your recommendation? Tic Tac Toe game is a simple game with no need for sensitive data or permission, so asking/storing of unnecessary information/permission is not required.
f.	How do you think your recommendation could be applied? My recommendation could be applied by not storing sensitive data and getting rid of them as soon as possible, also not asking for permission which are not required for functionality of the application.
i.	How feasible would the implementation be? The recommendation is highly feasible and could be applied to almost any project/application.
